# Dunder Mifflin Lists

### Employee Website for Lists, Tasks & Company Things

Paper supply company Dunder Mifflin has developped a web app that will allow employees to keep track of multiple lists of items grouped by category. The app allows employees to create custom categories for each list of items, and also to create and manage the list of items under each category. For example, an employee planning an office party may wish to create food, drinks and games categories. Page can be found [here](https://dundermifflin-lists.netlify.app/).
